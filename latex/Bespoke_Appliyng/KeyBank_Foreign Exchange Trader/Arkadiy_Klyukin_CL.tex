\opening{Dear \company\ Hiring Manager,}

% ========== Cover Letter Text ==========
I am writing to express my interest in the Foreign Exchange Trader position at KeyBank as advertised. With a robust background in FX trading and risk management, complemented by direct experience in market making and client service, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

In my previous role at G_Bank, I was instrumental in managing and executing trades across a variety of FX products, including spots, forwards, swaps, and options. My responsibility for a daily trading volume in the hundreds of millions — across major currencies like USD, EUR, and GBP, as well as emerging market currencies — has equipped me with the agility and expertise required to thrive in dynamic financial markets. Moreover, my strategic input helped propel our team to achieve a dominant market position.

My technical proficiency extends to developing sophisticated trading tools and platforms, such as the Interest Rates Option pricing engine and the front office system integration via Calypso, enhancing transaction processing and compliance with global FX standards. At P_Bank, I led initiatives to refine electronic trading systems, significantly improving execution speeds and market penetration as evidenced by our top market share rankings.

I am particularly drawn to this role at KeyBank due to its emphasis on collaborative team dynamics and the opportunity to contribute to innovative FX trading strategies. I am eager to bring my background in statistical analysis and my proactive risk management approach to your esteemed team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background, skills, and enthusiasms align with the goals of KeyBank.

\closing{Sincerely,}
