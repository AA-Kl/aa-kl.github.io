\opening{Dear \company\ Hiring Manager,}

% ========== Cover Letter Text ==========
I am excited to apply for the Portfolio Manager position at Statkraft. I bring a wealth of experience in portfolio management, market-making, and risk assessment. I am confident in my ability to contribute to the Origination team's portfolio management.

My expertise in managing large-scale financial portfolios, optimizing profitability under various market conditions, and understanding market dynamics aligns perfectly with the job description. I have a proven track record in market making across a diverse range of financial instruments, delivering competitive pricing, actionable trade ideas, and enhanced financial stability. I have consistently surpassed PnL and market share KPIs, contributing to sustained growth.

In my previous roles, I've successfully launched new instruments pricing and liquidity providing aligned with ISDA regulations. I've developed advanced trading tools and optimized desk infrastructure, improving efficiency. I managed and analyzed currency exposures, executed strategic FX trades, implemented hedging techniques, achieving a quantifiable reduction in financial risk.

I am proficient with Python, C\#, Bloomberg API, ECN APIs, and SQL, which I've used to refine algorithms that improve trade accuracy and reduce latency. I've coordinated with legal and tax experts to ensure adherence to the ISDA framework and Dodd-Frank legal/regulatory compliance requirements.

I look forward to the opportunity to apply my skills and grow with your organization. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to discussing how I can contribute to Statkraft's success.
