\opening{Dear \company\ Hiring Manager,}

% ========== Cover Letter Text ==========
I am writing to express my interest in the Rates Systematic Trader role at Citi, as advertised. With over 15 years of progressive experience in the financial markets, specializing in rates trading and systematic strategies, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

Throughout my career at institutions like G_Bank and P_Bank, I have honed my abilities in managing substantial trading volumes, developing innovative trading systems, and leading high-performing teams. My hands-on experience in market making and liquidity provision across a range of financial instruments has empowered me to significantly impact business outcomes positively.

At G_Bank, I led several high-impact projects, including the development of an Interest Rates Option pricing engine and the integration of cutting-edge XVA approaches. These initiatives not only expanded our trading capabilities but also enhanced our compliance with evolving regulatory frameworks like ISDA and Dodd-Frank. My strategic focus on technology-driven solutions enabled the refinement of trading strategies, aligning them with dynamic market conditions and client needs.

Furthermore, my tenure at P_Bank was marked by innovations in electronic trading systems, where I spearheaded the development of advanced algorithms that optimized trade execution and risk management. My efforts were crucial in maintaining robust trading platforms that supported significant trading volumes and adhered to stringent risk controls.

I am particularly attracted to this opportunity at Citi because of your commitment to excellence and leadership in global markets. I am eager to bring my background in rates trading, along with my technical expertise and strategic insights, to your esteemed team. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background, skills, and certifications align with the goals of Citi.
