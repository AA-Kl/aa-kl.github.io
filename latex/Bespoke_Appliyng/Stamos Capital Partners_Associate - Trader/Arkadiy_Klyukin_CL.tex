\opening{Dear \company\ Hiring Manager,}

% ========== Cover Letter Text ==========
I am writing to express my interest in the Associate - Trader position at Stamos Capital Partners, as advertised. With over 5 years of experience in trading and financial markets, particularly in equities, FX, and derivatives, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your esteemed investment team.

At GPB, where I honed my skills in market-making and risk management, I led initiatives that significantly improved trading operations and compliance with evolving financial regulations such as SOFR and ISDA. My role involved deep market analysis, development of sophisticated trading strategies, and collaboration with legal and compliance teams to align our operations with industry standards.

At PSB, my focus was on leveraging technology to enhance trading efficiency. I successfully implemented several high-impact projects, including the development of a proprietary trading platform and advanced risk management tools. These initiatives not only improved our operational capabilities but also strengthened our market position and client relationships.

I am particularly drawn to the role at Stamos Capital Partners because of its commitment to innovation and excellence in investment management. My background in managing diverse asset classes and my proactive approach to market analysis and trading execution will allow me to add value to your team. I am eager to bring my expertise in trading technologies and strategic market positioning to further enhance SCP capabilities.

Thank with the opportunity to apply, and I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to the continued success and growth of Stamos Capital Partners.
