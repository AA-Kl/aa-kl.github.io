\opening{Dear \company\ Hiring Manager,}

% ========== Cover Letter Text ==========
I am writing to express my interest in the role of Capital Markets Lead at Affirm. With my extensive background in trading, risk management, and financial engineering, along with a proven track record in the development and execution of strategic trading and risk management frameworks, I am confident that I would be an excellent fit for this role.

In my previous roles, I have demonstrated my ability to manage complex portfolios, deliver innovative trading solutions, and achieve superior financial outcomes. Through my analytical acuity, I have successfully developed and executed trades that consistently outperformed market benchmarks. Utilizing Python, C#, Bloomberg API, ECN APIs, and SQL, I led the enhancement of trading tools, significantly improving trade accuracy and reducing latency.

I am well-versed in structured finance, fixed-income investing, trading, private equity, consulting, and product/strategy roles. This, coupled with my exceptional communication skills and ability to convey strategy to sophisticated counterparties, sets me apart from others.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my unique blend of skills and experience to a forward-thinking, market-leading company like Affirm and believe I could make a significant contribution to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills would make me a strong fit for your team.

\closing{Sincerely,}
