\opening{Dear \company\ Hiring Manager,}

% ========== Cover Letter Text ==========
I am writing to express my interest in the Application Manager - Treasury position at Meta. With over seven years of hands-on experience in configuring, implementing, and scaling Enterprise Treasury applications and a strong understanding of FIS Quantum integration capabilities, I believe I am an excellent fit for this role.

In my previous roles, I demonstrated strong expertise in managing and analyzing currency exposures, executing strategic FX trades, and implementing hedging techniques. I successfully managed portfolios within stringent financial limits, minimizing risks and maintaining credit quality. I also have a proven track record of providing expert advisory services on foreign exchange matters, contributing significantly to strategic financial planning and informed decision-making.

My experience in implementing robust risk assessment and mitigation strategies, in-depth balance sheet analysis, and Funds Transfer Pricing initiatives would make me a crucial asset to your team. I also have a strong ability to collaborate and influence cross-functional teams on process optimization and guide business partners and internal teams on making the right product and process decisions.

I am confident that my skills and experiences make me a strong candidate for this position. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to your team.

\closing{Sincerely,}
