\opening{Dear \company\ Hiring Manager,}

% ========== Cover Letter Text ==========
I am writing to express my interest in the Treasury Manager, Hedging and Capital Markets position at Intel as advertised. With a comprehensive background in capital markets, particularly in treasury management, derivative trading, and risk management, I am excited about the opportunity to bring my expertise to Intels Capital Markets Group.

Through my previous roles, I have cultivated a deep understanding of asset liability management, strategic hedging, and regulatory compliance, all of which are crucial for the role at Intel. At GPB, I led significant initiatives that involved complex financial modeling, market making for various financial instruments, and the development of sophisticated trading strategies that directly improved profitability and risk profiles. My strategic input and technical execution have consistently aligned with corporate financial goals, driving improvements in financial stability and performance metrics.

Additionally, my hands-on experience in managing high-value portfolios, executing advanced trading operations, and steering cross-functional projects makes me well-suited to contribute effectively to your team. I am particularly adept at integrating financial and strategic analysis with operational execution, which I understand is paramount for the role.

I am eager to bring my background in finance, combined with my proactive approach and problem-solving skills, to Intel. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background, skills, and enthusiasms align with the goals of Intels Capital Markets Group.

Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to your team.

\closing{Sincerely,}
