\opening{Dear \company\ Hiring Manager,}

% ========== Cover Letter Text ==========
I am writing to express my interest in the AI Training for Mathematic Reasoning role at Outlier, as advertised. I am a seasoned financial professional with robust skills in statistics, econometrics, and portfolio optimization, as well as an in-depth understanding of machine learning concepts. I am confident that my background aligns with the requirements of your role.

During my tenure at my previous positions, I led market-making activities, executed client transactions, and provided liquidity across a wide variety of financial instruments. This role allowed me to leverage my mathematical and statistical prowess in evaluating trade risks and managing portfolios, skills that I believe would be beneficial for training AI models in your organization.

My experience also includes developing and refining trading tools using Python, C\#, Bloomberg API, ECN APIs, and SQL, skills that would be useful for creating complex and thought-provoking Math \& Reasoning prompts. Additionally, I have led cross-functional teams in legal and operational roles, ensuring adherence to legal/regulatory compliance requirements.

I have a keen interest in AI and machine learning concepts, and I am excited about the prospect of combining this with my expertise in mathematics and financial markets. I believe my unique skill set makes me an excellent candidate for this role.

I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my candidacy further and show you how my skills, experience, and passion align with Outlier's mission and this role in particular.

Thank you for considering my application.

\closing{Sincerely,}
