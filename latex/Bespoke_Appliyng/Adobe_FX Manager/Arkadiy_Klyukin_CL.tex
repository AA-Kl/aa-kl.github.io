\opening{Dear \company\ Hiring Manager,}

% ========== Cover Letter Text ==========
I am writing to express my interest in the FX Manager position at Adobe, as advertised. With a robust background in FX trading, risk management, and financial modeling, combined with my proactive approach to market analysis and technological innovation, I am eager to bring my expertise to Adobe Treasury Foreign Exchange team.

In my previous role at Gazprombank, I led market-making operations and executed trades across multiple currencies and financial instruments, significantly enhancing liquidity and client service. My strategic approach in managing major trading portfolios, coupled with my skill in developing financial models, allowed me to effectively manage risks and optimize financial outcomes. 

At PSB, I spearheaded several projects that integrated cutting-edge technology to improve trading processes and efficiency. My leadership in these projects not only boosted our market position but also enhanced our client relationships through improved service delivery and innovation.

I am particularly drawn to this role at Adobe because of the opportunity to contribute to your renowned hedging programs and collaborate with a talented team to drive strategic improvements. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of bringing my unique blend of skills and experiences to Adobe, where I can contribute to managing FX exposures and achieving financial stability and growth.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to your team and help Adobe achieve its strategic financial objectives.

\closing{Sincerely,}
