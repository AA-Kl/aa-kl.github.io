\opening{Dear \company\ Hiring Manager,}

% ========== Cover Letter Text ==========
I'm thrilled to apply for the Derivatives Trader position at RGA Investments. With my strong background in quantitative finance and vast experience in trading derivatives across all asset classes, I'm confident in my ability to make a significant impact on your team.

My professional journey has honed my skills in market making, executing client transactions, providing liquidity, and managing portfolios. I have consistently optimized profitability and reduced financial risk. My expertise extends to implementing derivative strategies for hedging, replication, and income generation within block reinsurance transactions. In addition, I possess a deep understanding of asset and derivative pricing, backed by a strong ability to operate well in a team environment, manage concurrent projects, and adapt quickly to new methods.

Moreover, my solid programming knowledge with Python, MATLAB, SQL, C\#, and R, coupled with my experience in Agile methodologies, has equipped me to develop and refine trading algorithms that improve trade accuracy and reduce latency. I have also used these skills in successfully developing feeds collecting and smart order matching engine.

I am excited about the prospect of contributing my unique skills and experiences to your esteemed company. I am confident that I can make a significant contribution to your team and look forward to the possibility of discussing my candidacy further. 

Thank you for considering my application.
