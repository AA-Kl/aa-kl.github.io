\opening{Dear \company\ Hiring Manager,}

% ========== Cover Letter Text ==========
I am excited to apply for the position of Quantitative Research Analyst at Franklin Templeton. With my extensive experience in quantitative finance and computational methods, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your research team.

I have a proven record in conducting investment research, managing large volumes of data, and implementing potential improvements to investment processes. My experience in market making, executing client transactions, and providing clients with liquidity in diverse financial instruments will be beneficial in determining after-tax effects of investment strategies.

I am skilled in the use of Python, C\#, and SQL, which are essential for integrating required data into your Research Platform. My strong knowledge of relational data structures makes me adept at handling structured and unstructured data sources. 

As a team player with effective communication skills, I am capable of working independently or as part of a small team. My exposure to risk modeling, optimization, transaction costs, and quantitative profit construction will allow me to effectively contribute to your teamï¿½s research cycle.

I look forward to the possibility of discussing this opportunity further. Thank you for considering my application.

\closing{Sincerely,}
