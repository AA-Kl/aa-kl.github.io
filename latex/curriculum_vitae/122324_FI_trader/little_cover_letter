Hello Joel,

Merry Christmass!

My name is Arkadiy,
I apologize for reaching out directly, but I recently came across your posting for the Interest Rates Derivatives Trader role and felt compelled to connect. I saw that there are so many applications, my CV would probably never be found in this pile. Although I am not actively seeking new opportunities, the details in the job description resonated with my background so closely, i decided to reach out.

I have more than 10 years of experience as an Interest Rate (IR) and FX Trader and during my career i worked closely with many ex ING employees and traded actively with ING various types of products (mostly Interest Rates) constantly. Can easily get some referrals from colleagues in your London and Moscow office to reaffirm the quality of my work and our successful collaborations.

I am confident that i am a very good candidate for this position. Would appreciate the opportunity to discuss. Could we schedule a brief call at your convenience?

Attaching my latest CV.
Thank you in advance for considering my application. 

I look forward to the possibility to talk to you.

Best regards,
Arkadiy Klyukin
