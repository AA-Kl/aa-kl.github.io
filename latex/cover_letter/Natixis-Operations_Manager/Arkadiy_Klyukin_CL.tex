\opening{Dear Natixis Hiring Manager,}

I am writing to express my interest in the Operations Associate position at Natixis Investment Managers. With a strong background in facilitating client transactions, market making, and managing portfolios across various asset classes, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

In my previous roles, I have consistently exceeded performance metrics, developed and integrated trading tools, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to drive operational efficiency. My experience in implementing new instruments pricing, liquidity provision, and risk management aligns well with the responsibilities of facilitating trade settlements, conducting vendor oversight, and supporting client restriction reviews as outlined in the job description.

Furthermore, my certifications in quantitative finance, financial risk management, and the Chartered Financial Analyst designation demonstrate my commitment to professional development and expertise in the field. I am proficient in MS Office, Excel macros, and have experience with systems like Calypso, which I believe will be valuable in enhancing operational processes at Natixis Investment Managers.

I am eager to bring my unique skill set and experiences to your team and contribute to the continued success of Natixis Investment Managers. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,\\
Arkadiy Klyukin
